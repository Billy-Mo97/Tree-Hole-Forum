# Tree-Hole-Forum
Happy Game's UCI MCS CS297P course project.

## INTRODUCTION Motivation/Background:

At present, “Covid-19” becomes a worldwide problem. It doesn’t stop its step but keeps to disturb everyone’s life around the world. Some factories and companies are going out of business due to this virus, which makes some people are losing their jobs. People feel anxious under this environment, a survey shows that during the virus period, there are more and more people suffering from depression.
People need to be relaxed in such circumstance, a effective way to release them is to share their feelings and chat with other people. And considering the social distance and the safety of people’s health, things are going to happen through the internet instead of face to face.
Virtual communication becomes very important in this period, so we decide to develop an anonymous forum for people to share their feelings and stories. Also, through the comment within each published moment, they can chat and communicate with others. Anonymous is a key point in our project, people are willing to be active to talk more about themselves, their lives and their stories when other people don’t know anything about them. People need information about COVID-19, some instant information in the local area. Meanwhile, some protection against the virus can also help elder people. Sometimes what you need is not an answer, but a process of speaking out your troubles. In this process, the other guy will listen carefully and give you some insights.
As a result, we are going to develop a web-based project to help people share their problems and moods during this period.


## State of the Art / Innovation


One creative point of our project is to ensure anonymous to avoid privacy issue when user is sharing or communicating with other people. As for today’s famous forum, most of them are not anonymous and sometimes people will worry about their privacy problems. Our forum makes a change in this point and we will also check if there exists improper content in user’s published comments.

### Project Goals

(Describe the project general goals. Max 200 words).
Well-Functioning forum
Problem: People need a place on the internet to share their anxiety and talk to others. They want to find a way to release themselves in this period.
Solution: We will develop a website where people can publish a moment to write what they want. And a user can also read others’ moments and write his comment based on this moment. A moment is an element in this our designed forum, people communicate with others by this.

### Anonymous forum

Problem: When people are sharing their anxiety or problems during the “Covid-19” period, if their friends or relatives have seen this, it will cause some psychological burdens. Therefore, Speaking out your problems anonymously, sharing your anxiety to strangers will not cause any psychological burdens. Your audience will only listen, and answer your if they can, instead of cause any privacy issue.
Solution: We will not show any information about users in others’ interface, every user in this system can only see their own information. And we also decide to encrypt user’s key information in our storage to protect user’s privacy.

### User verification

Problem: Our project should divide user into different roles to control their authority and we also want people to establish their account in this system to make it more convenient to manage user’s information.
Solution: We will develop a concise log in interface. User can sign up and sign in in this page and it contains a complete verification process when user sign in this system and can obtain its authority based on its account.
